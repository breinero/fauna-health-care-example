TODO


When a new patient is created in the system, a set of new consents are added that are assigned to the patient.


*** Administration of Enterprise Consent Standard
The management of all the consents for each individual in an organization

*** Consent Standards Adherence Support
The set of regulatory requirements by state, or even nation. This is the model by which a patient's current consent set is compared, and how unmet consent requirements are identified.

*** Monitoring and Impact Reporting
When a consent changes this system reports what access to data has changed and for who it has changed.
